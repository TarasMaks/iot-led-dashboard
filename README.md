This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  

This particular React app is being used as a Realtime LED Dashbord domonstrating the usage of the MQTT protocol.  The [companion project](https://github.com/pprimm/iot-esp) is an embedded MQTT system build around the ESP8266 NodeMCU development board.
